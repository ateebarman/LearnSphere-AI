## ⚡ Performance & Database Optimization
*Engineered for scale and millisecond latency.*

### 1. Redis Caching (Upstash)
We implement a **multi-tier caching strategy** using Redis to reduce MongoDB load by ~85%:
- **Knowledge Base Detail**: Individual topic pages cached for 1 hour.
- **Community Roadmaps**: Public list cached for 30 minutes; individual details for 1 hour.
- **Analytics Overview**: Heavy aggregation results cached for 10 minutes per user.
- **Problem Lists**: Paginated search results cached for 10 minutes.

### 2. Advanced MongoDB Indexing
Optimized query execution using compound and text indexes:
- `Roadmap`: `{ user: 1, createdAt: -1 }` for instant dashboard loads.
- `Submission`: `{ user: 1, question: 1, status: 1 }` for checking problem solve status.
- `Interview`: `{ candidateId: 1, createdAt: -1 }` for fast history retrieval.
- `QuizAttempt`: `{ user: 1, roadmap: 1 }` for module completion checks.

### 3. Query Efficiency
- **Lean Queries**: All read-only operations use `.lean()` to bypass Mongoose hydration overhead.
- **Partial Projections**: Fetching only required fields (`.select()`) to minimize network payload.
- **Standardized Pagination**: Uniform `page` and `limit` (default 15) across all Admin and Library endpoints.

## 🛡️ Admin & Control Engine
*The power to manage an entire curriculum.*

The **Admin Dashboard** provides a professional-grade interface for content curators:
- **Problem Management**: Create, Edit, or **AI-Generate** coding problems including test cases and starter code.
- **Knowledge Library**: Bulk manage documentation. Includes an **AI Knowledge Generator** that creates 500+ word deep-dives, ELI5 intuition, and complexity markers.
- **Roadmap Operations**: Create official roadmaps or "Officialize" community-generated ones.
- **Validation Suite**: Built-in logic to test and validate problem correctness before publishing.

## 🧠 Core Modules Detailed

### 1. Personalized AI Roadmaps
Unlike standard AI lists, LearnSphere roadmaps are **Hyper-Linked Ecosystems**:
- **Resource Sourcing**: Dynamically fetches the top 2-4 YouTube tutorials for every module.
- **Library Integration**: Automatically links module topics to our internal **Knowledge Base** entries.
- **Effort Estimation**: Provides reading and practice time estimates (minutes) for every module.
- **Unlock Criteria**: Gamified gating ensuring users master a module (Quiz 70%+) before proceeding.

### 2. Coding Arena & Judge System
Integrated with **Judge0** for high-performance code execution:
- **Languages**: Full support for `JavaScript`, `Python`, and `C++`.
- **Infrastructure**: Test case runner that compares `STDOUT` against expected outputs with precision.
- **Feedback**: Instant pass/fail status with detailed error logs and time/memory execution metrics.

### 3. Knowledge Base (Docs 2.0)
Our knowledge nodes are more than just text:
- **Intuition (ELI5)**: Real-world analogies for complex concepts (e.g., "Think of a Hash Table like a Library Catalog").
- **Multi-Lang Examples**: Most topics include code in 3+ languages.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Big O time and space complexity clearly tagged for interview prep.
- **Further Reading**: Curated links to official MDN, GeeksForGeeks, or documentation.

### 4. RAG Engine (PDF Analysis)
Upload study guides or textbook PDFs to generate customized roadmaps and quizzes grounded strictly in the uploaded materials using vector embeddings and LangChain.

### 5. AI Mock Interview Studio (Voice & Real-Time)
A comprehensive, end-to-end simulated technical and behavioral interview studio:
- **Multi-Stage Engine**: Automated stage flow covering `Warm-Up` → `Introduction` → `Resume Project Deep-Dive` → `DSA / Coding` → `System Design` → `HR Round` → `Comprehensive Evaluation Report`.
- **Voice & Speech Intelligence**: Powered by Web Speech API for speech-to-text input and natural TTS speech synthesis output. Includes live confidence meters and speaking duration timers.
- **Silence Watchdog**: Proactively provides warm nudges if the user is silent, gracefully helping candidates think through complex problems.
- **Embedded Code Workspace**: Monaco Editor integrated inside the interview room allowing candidates to solve live DSA problems while explaining their logic to the AI interviewer.
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Auto-evaluates candidates on Technical Competency, Communication, Problem Solving, and Confidence with an actionable improvement roadmap.

## 🧪 Testing & Benchmarking
We take performance seriously. Use these scripts to verify your setup:

- **`verifyDbSetup.js`**: Checks MongoDB index presence and Redis connectivity.
- **`dbBenchmark.js`**: Measures API response times (Cold vs. Warm cache) for Analytics, Library, and Roadmaps.
- **`geminiStressTest.js`**: Validates AI API rate-limiting handling and key rotation.
